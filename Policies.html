<h1>Policies</h1>

<h2>Return Policy</h2>
<p>Joyce Leslie stores do not offer refunds on purchases. A strict exchange-only policy is in effect. Merchandise can be exchanged within 14 days of the initial purchase date for other goods, or for the full purchase amount on a gift card. As a company, we stand behind the quality of our merchandise – refunds will continue to be honored for defective, flawed or otherwise imperfect merchandise.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. At times, we may ask you to provide information about yourself. For example, some of the information collected may include name, title, address, phone number, email address, and personal information concerning your interests, occupation, gender and other demographic information.</p>

<h2>Contacting You Concerning Promotions and New Products</h2>
<p>We may request you to opt-in to receive certain communications at our Point-of-Sale or website. We will not send messages to you concerning promotions or new products or other marketing material unless you have opted-in. Please see the sections “How Can I Opt Out” below for information on how to stop receiving our e-mail communications.</p>

<h2>How We Use Information You Submit to Us</h2>
<p>We use your information to provide services to you, including coupons, customer alerts and special offers. We may combine your personally identifying information and information about your preferences and activities with those of all or a particular group of our shoppers to prepare collective profiles of our users and their activities for our internal use. For example, we may track the number of our users who purchase certain product or use certain features on our website, or compile the total dollar amount of sales transacted in a particular geographic region or to track purchasing trends. Such information, and other information we derive from individual users’ information, allows us to continue to grow and provide you with quality information through more accurate marketing and advertising. We may also share aggregated information concerning our users, without attribution of personal information, to other companies with whom we conduct business.</p>

<h2>How Can I Opt-out of Receiving Email Communications</h2>
<p>We will not send e-mail messages to you if you indicate that you do not wish to receive such messages. If you do not wish to receive email messages from us, please email  Joyce Leslie at customerservice@joyceleslie.com. Place “UNSUBSCRIBE” in the subject line. It may take up to 10 days for mailing preference changes to take effect, and you may receive e-mail messages during this time.</p>
